## About Me

I'm 20 years old originally from South Africa, however I am currently staying in the Ã…land Islands. I have been interested in technology from a young age, and it has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. Looking to start a job as either a Jr. Penetration Tester, or as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 Analyst.
